# candpixie.github.io

This repository holds the source for the personal website of candpixie. It is configured to be served by GitHub Pages from the main branch (root).

## Contents
- index.html — a minimal starting page. Replace with your site content or add a build workflow for your framework.

## Deploy instructions
1. Push changes to the `main` branch.
2. On GitHub, go to Settings → Pages and set the source to `main` branch / `root` (or enable GitHub Actions deployment if you prefer automatic builds).

If you want, tell me which framework you use (plain HTML, React, Vite, Next.js, Eleventy, Hugo, etc.) and I will add build/deploy configuration (package.json and GitHub Actions workflow) and push them for you.
